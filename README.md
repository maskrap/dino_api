## GOAL
Practice using all of the build tools that we have learned so far to create an app centered around your choice of public JSON APIs which support CORS.

* Be sure to use all your gulp tasks as well as a development server with live reloading.
* Use Bower to manage your frontend dependencies creating vendor.css and vendor.js files to load in the browser.
* Try out some SASS for your styles and remember to modify your gulpfile to include compiling your SASS.
* Don't forget graceful error handling!

### Dino Ipsum
Explore this API to allow your users to generate dinosaur themed Lorem Ipsum. Use it any way you like - you could create a dinosaur themed game along the lines of hangman.
